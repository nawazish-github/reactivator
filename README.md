# reactivator
[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) implementation in the Golang Language. This library implements the **Observable Pattern** to enable asynchronous processing of Observable streams. 

**Reactivator** operators are composable which helps create complex computation pipelines easy. Currently the following Observable operators are available:

## Creating Observables
1. From
2. Range
3. Interval

## Transforming Observables
1. Map

## Filtering Observables
1. Filter
2. Limit

## Usage Examples
As of now, for usage, refer to test files associated with each Operator.
